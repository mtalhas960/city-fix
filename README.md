## 📊 Impact

### Who benefits from the solution?
Citizens, municipal authorities, urban planners, and environmental agencies benefit from the solution. Citizens gain a direct and efficient channel for reporting issues, while authorities can manage and prioritize urban issues more effectively. Urban planners can use the data to inform infrastructure development.

### How big is the problem?
Urban issues like potholes, broken streetlights, and waste dumping cost cities millions each year. According to the World Bank, cities generate 2.01 billion tonnes of solid waste annually. In cities like New York, over 300,000 potholes are reported annually, causing significant safety concerns and economic damage.

### How can the solution scale?
CityFix can be scaled globally, starting from a city level to regional and national levels. The platform can be adopted by municipalities worldwide through partnerships and urban innovation grants. The system is adaptable to various types of civic issues, such as waste management, infrastructure, and public safety.

### Environmental Impact
By helping cities address infrastructure issues quickly, CityFix reduces the long-term environmental damage caused by poorly maintained infrastructure, contributing to more sustainable urban development and cleaner environments.
